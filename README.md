# Animal-Re-identification-System-for-Behavior-Analysis
This paper uses machine-learning models to identify individual pigeons, koi fish, and pigs from annotated video data. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of these models critically and contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of animal identification systems.
